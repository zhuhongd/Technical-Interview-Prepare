LeetCode 1475: Final Prices With a Special Discount in a Shop

You are given an array 'prices' where prices[i] is the price of the ith item.

For each item, if there is a later item j (j > i) such that prices[j] <= prices[i],
you get a discount of prices[j].

Return a new list 'answer' where answer[i] = prices[i] - discount (if found), or just prices[i] otherwise.

Examples:
Input:  prices = [8, 4, 6, 2, 3]
Output: [4, 2, 4, 2, 3]

Input:  prices = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Input:  prices = [10, 1, 1, 6]
Output: [9, 0, 1, 6]

üß† How It Works:

We use a monotonic stack to track unresolved prices. For each price:
- While the current price is less than or equal to the top of the stack, we found a discount!
- Pop from stack and apply the discount to that previous index.
- Push the current index to the stack.

Stack stores indices, not values, so we can modify 'result' directly when we find a valid discount.

‚è± Time Complexity: O(n)
- Each index is pushed/popped from the stack at most once.

üì¶ Space Complexity: O(n)
- Stack stores up to n indices in the worst case.
