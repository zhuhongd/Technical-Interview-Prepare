# Week 3 — Sliding Window (Fixed & Variable Size)

> “Don’t scan; slide.”  
> — Every efficient LeetCode solver

### 🎯 Week Goal (and study tie‑in)
Master fixed-size, variable-size, and deque-backed sliding windows so you can turn O(n²) scans into O(n) passes.  
**Research hook:** Log how recognizing this pattern changes your solve time and confidence vs. brute force.

## 1. Why Sliding Window?

When a problem asks about **contiguous** subarrays/substrings, sliding window often replaces brute-force enumeration.  
We build on Week 2’s two-pointer intuition—now we **expand** and **shrink** a window to maintain constraints.

## 2. When to Use It

| If the prompt mentions…                          | Think…                            |
|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| “Window of size `k`”                             | **Fixed-size** window             |
| “Smallest/longest subarray with sum ≥ / ≤ X”     | **Variable-size** expand–shrink   |
| “Longest substring without repeating characters” | Variable window + set/map         |
| “Max/min in each window”                         | Fixed window + **monotonic deque**|
| “Frequency/count of chars in substring”          | Window + hashmap/counter          |

## 3. Types & Templates

### 🔹 Fixed-size Window
Size is given (e.g., `k`):

```python
L = 0
curr = 0
for R in range(len(nums)):
    curr += nums[R]
    if R - L + 1 > k:
        curr -= nums[L]
        L += 1
    # process window when size == k
```

### 🔹 Variable-Size Window (expand–shrink)

We grow `R`, then shrink `L` until the window satisfies a condition:

```python
L = 0
for R in range(len(s)):
    # include s[R] in the window
    ...
    while condition_is_violated():
        # exclude s[L] from the window
        L += 1
    # window [L..R] now satisfies the condition
```

### 🔹 Monotonic Deque Window (max/min in O(1))

Maintain indices in a deque in decreasing (for max) or increasing (for min) order so the **front is always the answer**.  
- Pop from the **back** while the new value breaks monotonicity.  
- Pop from the **front** if it falls out of the current window.
