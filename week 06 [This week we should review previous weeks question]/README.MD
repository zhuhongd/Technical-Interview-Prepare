# Week 06 – Revision & Practice Week  

This week is dedicated to **reviewing and consolidating** everything you’ve learned so far (Weeks 1–5).  
No new problems are introduced — instead, use this time to refresh your memory, identify weak spots, and strengthen your problem-solving speed.  

---

## 📌 Goals for This Week
- Reinforce your understanding of core patterns (HashMap, Stack, Two Pointers, Sliding Window, Binary Search).  
- Practice **without relying on solutions** — simulate real interview conditions.  
- Build confidence by solving familiar problems more quickly and cleanly.

## 🔁 Suggested Review Problems
Here’s a recommended set of problems to revisit:

### Week 1 – HashMap / HashSet / Heap / List
- Two Sum  
- Group Anagrams  
- Top K Frequent Elements  

### Week 2 – Stack
- Min Stack  
- Daily Temperatures  
- Car Fleet  

### Week 3 – Two Pointers
- Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array  
- Three Sum  

### Week 4 – Sliding Window
- Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters  
- Minimum Window Substring  
- Minimum Size Subarray Sum  

### Week 5 – Binary Search
- Search in Rotated Sorted Array  
- Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array

## ⏱️ Practice Guidelines
- **Timer**: Spend 30–45 mins per problem. If stuck, write down what you tried before peeking.  
- **Active Recall**: Don’t look at old solutions unless absolutely stuck.  
- **Explain Out Loud**: Pretend you’re teaching a peer. This exposes gaps in your logic.  
- **Complexity Check**: Always state the time and space complexity after solving.  

---

## 🌟 Stretch Challenge (Optional)
If you finish early, try combining techniques:
- Sliding Window + HashMap → Longest Repeating Character Replacement  
- Binary Search + Two Pointers → Koko Eating Bananas

## ✅ End of Week Reflection
- Which patterns feel natural now?  
- Which problems still feel shaky?  
- Are you solving faster compared to Week 1?  

This reflection will guide your focus for the upcoming weeks.

⚡ **Remember**: Consistency beats intensity. The goal is not to memorize solutions, but to *recognize patterns* and apply them confidently in any variation.
