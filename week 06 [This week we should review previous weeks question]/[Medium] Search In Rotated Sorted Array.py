🔍 Problem: Search in Rotated Sorted Array (week 05)

You are given a rotated version of a sorted array with **distinct integers**.
Return the index of the target if it's found, otherwise return -1.

Example:
Input: nums = [3,4,5,6,1,2], target = 1 → Output: 4
Input: nums = [3,5,6,0,1,2], target = 4 → Output: -1

Constraints:
- All elements are unique
- Time complexity must be O(log n)
- 1 <= len(nums) <= 1000
