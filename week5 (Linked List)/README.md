## 1. Why Linked Lists?

Linked lists are fundamental data structures frequently tested in technical interviews. They're crucial because:

- **Pointers and References**: They test your understanding of object references and pointer manipulation.
- **Dynamic Data Management**: Excellent for situations where insertions and deletions occur frequently.
- **Foundation for Advanced Structures**: Trees, graphs, stacks, and queues often rely on linked-list mechanics.

When interview problems involve **reordering**, **merging**, **reversing**, **detecting cycles**, or **removal operations**, linked lists often provide optimal and elegant solutions.

**Mastering linked lists means mastering pointer manipulation‚Äîa key skill for coding interviews.**

## 2. Linked Lists vs. Arrays

| Operation               | Array          | Linked List       | Winner?        |
| ----------------------- | -------------- | ----------------- | -------------- |
| Access by index         | **O(1)**       | O(n)              | üèÜ Array       |
| Insert/Delete at start  | O(n)           | **O(1)**          | üèÜ Linked List |
| Insert/Delete at end    | O(1) amortized | O(n)\*            | üèÜ Array       |
| Insert/Delete in middle | O(n)           | O(n)              | ‚öñÔ∏è Tie         |
| Memory overhead         | Low            | Higher (pointers) | üèÜ Array       |

\*With a tail pointer, linked lists achieve O(1) insertion at the end.

**Key takeaway:** Linked lists shine when frequent insertions/deletions occur, especially at the start. Arrays excel at random-access.

## 3. Key Concepts

### Singly Linked List

- Each node contains a `val` and a `next` pointer.
- The `head` points to the first node; `None` marks the end.
- Traversal starts at the head and continues via `node.next`.
- Deletion and insertion can be **O(1)** if node reference is known.

```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val):
        self.val = val
        self.next = None
```

### Circular Linked List

- Last node‚Äôs `next` points back to some previous node (or head).
- Useful for looping structures but needs cycle detection.
- **Danger:** Traversal can go into infinite loop if not handled properly.

### Doubly Linked List

- Each node contains `val`, `next`, and `prev`.
- Enables two-way traversal.
- Insertions/deletions become easier with direct access to previous nodes.

```python
class DListNode:
    def __init__(self, val):
        self.val = val
        self.next = None
        self.prev = None
```
