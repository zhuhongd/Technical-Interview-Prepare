# Technical-Interview-Prepare

> **Pattern-based interview prep + mini research project**  
> Summer/Fall 2025 · York University

## 🚀 What is this?

This repo is a **12‑week, pattern-first roadmap** for technical interview prep (LeetCode-style DSA + light design/OOP).  

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

1. **Learn by patterns, not problems**: Hashes → Stacks/Queues → Two Pointers → Sliding Window → Binary Search → rees/BSTs → …  
2. **Document everything** clearly (code, complexity, common mistakes).  
3. **Collect data** (time, attempts, reflections) to analyze learning impact.

 ## 🗂 Repo Structure
 ```
 ├── week1 (Hashmap, Hashset, List)
 ├── week2 (Stack / Monotonic Structures)
 ├── week3 (Two Pointers)
 ├── week4 (Sliding Window)
 ├── week5 (Binary Search)
 ├── week6 (Linked List)
 ├── week7 (Trees & BST fundamentals)
 │   └── ... (additional contents in week7)
 ├── things_you_need_to_know.ipynb   # Core “must know” templates/notes
 └── README.md                       # This file
 ```
 
 **Contents of each week folder:**
 - `README.md`: Concepts, why it matters, practice table, and skip test.
 - Numbered Python files (`.py`) containing solutions with both brute-force and optimized approaches, and comments.
 - Sometimes a Jupyter notebook for deeper dives (if applicable).

## 🧭 How to Use This Repo

### If you’re here to **learn**:
1. Start at **Week 1** and read the week’s README.  
2. Solve problems in order. Force yourself to write **both brute-force and optimal** solutions.  
3. Watch the youtube video for explaination, but do the questions in order.

### If you’re here to **revise your knowledge**:
- Pass the **Skip Test** to move to the next week.

## ✅ Conventions

- File names: `N. [difficulty] Problem Name [Pattern].py`
- Each file includes:
  - Problem statement (short)
  - Brute-force idea (if relevant)
  - Optimized approach + complexity
  - “Knowledge” tags (e.g., `[Knowledge 1.]`)

---

## 🔧 Future Improvements / TODO

- Add unit tests for helper templates 
- Visual diagrams for tree ops / sliding windows  

---

## 📚 References

- NeetCode Roadmap / Blind 75 / Tech Interview Handbook  
- Official Python docs (dict, set, collections)  
- Course: EECS4070 Directed Study (York University)
